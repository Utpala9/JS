# Hello Internet, I’m learning JavaScript (in public)

No “expert” claims.  
No “10+ years of experience” drama.  
Just me, curiosity, and a lot of `console.log()`.

I’m starting my **JavaScript public learning journey** today — sharing:
- what I learn  
- what I break  
- what finally clicks  

### Why public?
Because learning alone is slow.  
Learning **with the internet watching** keeps you honest.

If you’re:
- learning JavaScript too  
- switching from another language  
- or just enjoy watching beginners grow  

Feel free to:
- follow along  
- correct me  
- point out bugs  
- or learn with me  

**Day 1 starts now.**  
Build. Fail. Fix. Repeat.
